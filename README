Compiling and Running Rapid Prototype:
--------------------------------------------------------------


The prototype is ran on the command line. It can be ran on any CCIS Linux machines. 
The prototype input takes two files. 
A file can be a file in WAVE or MP3 format or a folder containing files in the WAVE or MP3 format


On a CCIS Linux Machine:


1. Open the command line. 


2. cd into our project directory named src. This directory contains the executable.


$ cd src


3. Move files you wish to compare into our project directory.


4. Execute the following command:


$ ./p4500 -f <name> -f <name>

Enter either -f for WAV/MP3 file, or -d for directory consisting the WAV/MP3 files.
<name> is the path of the directory or file that is going to be compared.

5. The program will compare the files to see if one file is likely to have been derived from the other. 
If so, then the program will print "MATCH: <filename> <filename>‚Äù to standard output, followed by a newline.  
If not, then the program will not output anything and continue onto comparing the next files. 
The program will terminate after all files have been compared.
